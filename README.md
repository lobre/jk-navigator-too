## JK-Navigator-Too

With JK-Navigator-Too (jkn2), you can use `j` and `k` to select elements on a number of popular web sites;
for example, search results on Google, or news stories on the BBC,
or Reddit posts, etc.

In addition, the `Enter` key activates the link associated with the selected
element.  Searching Google usually becomes something like `j-j-Enter`; browsing
Reddit: `j-Enter`, `j-Enter`.

#### Getting Started

1. Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jk-navigator-tooaakbjkmojammjfadiljkfkmfbbfc).

1. Navigate to [here](http://jkn2.smblott.org/) and browse the available rule
   sets:  for example, [Google Search](http://jkn2.smblott.org/search/jkn2-google.txt),
   [DuckDuckGo](http://jkn2.smblott.org/search/jkn2-duckduckgo.txt),
   [Twitter](http://jkn2.smblott.org/search/jkn2-duckduckgo.txt),
   [Reddit](http://jkn2.smblott.org/social/jkn2-reddit.txt)
   or various [UK News sites](http://jkn2.smblott.org/news/jkn2-news-UK.txt).

1. When you visit the configuration files above, a popup appears at the bottom
   right-hand side of the screen.  You can import the rule set by clicking "Yes
   please".

#### Further customisation

It is possible to write your own rule sets; however, unfortunately, the process
isn't yet properly documented.  If you're feeling brave, then take a look
[here](https://github.com/smblott-github/jk-navigator-too/tree/master/config).

New and improved rules sets are very welcome.  Please submit them as PRs here on github.
